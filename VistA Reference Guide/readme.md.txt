## VistA Reference Guide

The VistA Reference Guide was created by the VistA Office to provide product teams with a valuable reference document which must be followed to ensure the success of internal and external products interfacing with VistA. The VistA Reference Guide is intended for product team members, including Developers, Product Line Managers, and Stakeholders who make design decisions for the product being developed.

The VistA Reference Guide contains eight sections with each section detailing a separate process relating to VistA.  These sections are the VistA Office Review Board (VORB), Standards and Conventions (SAC), VistA Package/Namespace Setup, Integration Control Registration (ICR), Interface Requirements, Kernel Security, VistA National Patch Release Requirements, and VistA System Security Assessments.
