## ICR Process and Standards

Welcome to the OIT DSO SPM Health VistA Office's Integration Control Registrations (ICR) SharePoint site!
Integration Control Registrations (ICRs) are integration agreements between VistA components when using the MUMPS (M) software development language, such as where a Class 1, 2, or 3 product/package, has an external reference to another packageâ€™s file, routine, remote procedure, option, protocol, or other software components. This page was designed to provide full ICR support to VA staff and contractors who require the review/approval of a new ICR or changes to an existing ICR.
